# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive with Invalid Class Name

This repository demonstrates a potential issue when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive with a class name that doesn't exist in your Tailwind configuration or CSS.

## The Problem
The `@apply` directive in Tailwind CSS is a powerful tool for applying utility classes.  However, if you use `@apply` with an invalid class name (e.g., a typo or a class that hasn't been defined), it will simply be ignored.  This can be difficult to debug, as you might not see any errors in the console, and your styles won't appear as expected. 

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` (if necessary).
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.
4. Observe that the `<div>` element has no styling applied because `invalid-class` is not a valid Tailwind CSS class.

## Solution
The solution is to double-check your Tailwind configuration, make sure the class name is spelled correctly, and ensure that the class exists in your CSS or configuration files.  Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the element and identify missing styles.  Linters and Tailwind's IntelliSense features in IDEs can also help prevent such errors.
